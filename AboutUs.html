            	<p class="par">
                <br><b>Astronomy Picture of the Day:</b>  NASA Open APIs make available NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to software 					developers. One of the most popular NASA Open APIs is the Astronomy Picture of the Day'(APOD). It structures the APOD imagery and 					associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications
                <br><br><b>Currency conversion:</b>  Provides currency exchange rates based on the markets and national central banks data.
                <br><br><b>Weather Forecast:</b>  Weather Forecast displayed using the Open Weather API. It allows you to gather  			<br>weather data for over 200,000 cities.You can also use the API to get access to historical weather data.The data collection 					includes  <br>Current  Weather Data, Hourly Weather Data 4 Days, Daily forecast 16 days, Climatic Forecast 30 days, etc.
                <br><br><b>Countries Information:</b>  Shows information of the selected country. Implemented with the REST Countries API which is a RESTful 		API that allows you to get information about the world's countries. <br>For example, you can send a query to get a country's 					language, currency, and capital.
                <br><br><b>News API:</b> We show news from around the world. This is enabled with the News API , a simple and easy-to-use API that returns 			JSON-formatted news from a variety of sources.
                </p>
                <h2><br><br><i> <u>Architectrue and Soltion Highlights of  our  WebApp:</u></i></h2>
                <p class="par">
                <br><b>Fully Decoupled Architecture: </b>  User interface layer fully decoupled and independent with backend layer. So any change in one 		layer or component (User Interface, Backend APIs) will not impact code in other layer.
                <br><br><b>Digital Backend:</b>  Digital backend (built with independent APIs) layer (component), since composed of multiple independent 		APIs ensures no single point of failure (if there is issue one API other functionality keeps working).
                <br><br><b>Globally Available API:</b>  It enables using API as building blocks and avoid reinventing the wheel. Not spent time in 		developing APIs for functionality which is already available saves time and cost.
                <br><br><b>Rapid Development:</b> Solution approach enables rapid development which reduces time of development and faster launch of various 		functionalities.
